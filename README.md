# TimeSeries_Regression_Ensembling_Model

Use time series model and regression model on forecasting Bitcoin price and showcase the power of the combined model of the two

# Data

  - Bitcoin data: generate from [here](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)
  
# Approach

  - Time sereis model only
  
  - Time sereis model + regression model 
  
    (regression model > residuals > imput of arima model > combined results from the two to form final predictions)
    
  - Comparison of the two approachs
  
  - Including visualization and arima model (p,d,q) selection
  

**Showcase the power of ensembling models, particular in forecasting analysis with apparent trends that can be identified by regressions (linear, poly, etc.). Very welcome for further discussions!**
