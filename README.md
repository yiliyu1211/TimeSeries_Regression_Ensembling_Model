# TimeSeries_Regression_Ensembling_Model

Using time series model and regression model on forecasting Bitcoin price and showcase the power of the ensembling model of the two

# Data

  - Bitcoin data: generate from [here](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin)
  
# Approach

  - Time sereis model only
  
  - Time sereis model + regression model 
  
    (regression model > residuals > imput of arima model > combined results from the two to form final predictions)
  
  - Including visualization and arima model (p,d,q) selection
  

# Showcase the power of ensembling models, particular in forecasting analysis with apparent trends that can be identified by regressions. Very welcome for further discussions!
